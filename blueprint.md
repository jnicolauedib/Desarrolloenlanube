# Pegasus Global Cars - Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a modern, responsive landing page for Pegasus Global Cars. The landing page will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following modern web standards.

## Project Plan

1.  **Basic HTML Structure:**
    *   Create a header with the company name and navigation.
    *   Create a main section for the page content.
    *   Create a footer with social media links and copyright information.

2.  **Styling with CSS:**
    *   Implement a modern design with a unique color palette and typography.
    *   Use CSS variables for easy theming.
    *   Ensure the layout is responsive and works on all screen sizes.
    *   Add a subtle noise texture to the background for a premium feel.
    *   Use multi-layered drop shadows to create a sense of depth.

3.  **Content:**
    *   **Hero Section:** A full-width hero section with a captivating background image and a strong call to action.
    *   **Featured Cars Section:** A section to showcase a few of the company's best cars. This will use a web component for the car cards.
    *   **Contact Us Form:** A simple form for users to get in touch.

4.  **Interactivity with JavaScript:**
    *   Add interactivity to the navigation and contact form.
    *   Use ES Modules to organize the JavaScript code.

5.  **Web Components:**
    *   Create a reusable web component for the "Featured Car" card. This will encapsulate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the card, making it easy to reuse and maintain.

## Design

*   **Aesthetics:** Modern, clean, and visually balanced layout.
*   **Fonts:** Expressive and relevant typography.
*   **Color:** Vibrant and energetic color palette.
*   **Texture:** Subtle noise texture on the main background.
*   **Visual Effects:** Multi-layered drop shadows for depth and a "lifted" look for cards.
*   **Iconography:** Icons to enhance understanding and navigation.
*   **Interactivity:** Interactive elements will have a "glow" effect.

## Accessibility
