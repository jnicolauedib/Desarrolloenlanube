# Blueprint: Maserati-Inspired Landing Page

## Overview

This project is a single-page web application that showcases luxury cars, with a design inspired by the official Maserati website. It features a stunning hero section, a curated list of featured vehicles, and a clean, modern aesthetic.

## Implemented Features

*   **Header & Navigation:** A clean, minimalistic header with a logo and navigation links.
*   **Hero Section:** A full-screen hero section with a captivating background image and a prominent call-to-action.
*   **Featured Cars Section:** A section to showcase a selection of vehicles using custom Web Components (`<car-card>`).
*   **Web Components:** The car cards are implemented as custom elements for reusability and encapsulation.

## Current Plan: Redesign to Emulate Maserati

The goal of this redesign is to elevate the visual presentation of the website to match the luxury and sophistication of the Maserati brand.

### Plan of Action

1.  **Update HTML (`index.html`):**
    *   Change the page title to "Maserati - Luxury Cars".
    *   Update the logo text in the header to "MASERATI".
    *   Modify the hero section's title and subtitle to be more brand-aligned.
    *   Update the "Featured Cars" section title.

2.  **Update CSS (`style.css`):**
    *   Introduce a new color palette (deep blue, black, white, silver).
    *   Import and apply a new, elegant font from Google Fonts.
    *   Redesign the header and navigation to be transparent and overlay the hero section.
    *   Make the hero section full-viewport height (`100vh`).
    *   Add a dark overlay to the hero image to improve text legibility.
    *   Restyle buttons to have a more premium look.
    *   Enhance the styling of the car cards with shadows and refined typography.

3.  **Update JavaScript (`main.js`):**
    *   Update the `featuredCars` array to include Maserati models with high-quality images.
